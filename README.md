# **IT Security Policies**

This repository contains three core security documents:

* **Acceptable Use Standard**
* **Password Construsction Standard**
* **Identity Management Policy**

These policies define how users should interact with IT resources, how passwords must be created and managed, and how access rights are assigned within the organization.
